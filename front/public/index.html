  CHAPTER I<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  "Well, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the<br>
  Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don't tell me that this means war,<br>
  if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by<br>
  that Antichrist- I really believe he is Antichrist- I will have<br>
  nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer<br>
  my 'faithful slave,' as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see<br>
  I have frightened you- sit down and tell me all the news."<br>
  <br>
  It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna<br>
  Pavlovna Scherer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress Marya<br>
  Fedorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vasili Kuragin, a man<br>
  of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her<br>
  reception. Anna Pavlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as<br>
  she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in<br>
  St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.<br>
  <br>
  All her invitations without exception, written in French, and<br>
  delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:<br>
  <br>
  "If you have nothing better to do, Count [or Prince], and if the<br>
  prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too<br>
  terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10-<br>
  Annette Scherer."<br>
  <br>
  "Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied the prince, not in the<br>
  least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing<br>
  an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had<br>
  stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke<br>
  in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but<br>
  thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a<br>
  man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went<br>
  up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald,<br>
  scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the<br>
  sofa.<br>
  <br>
  "First of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend's<br>
  mind at rest," said he without altering his tone, beneath the<br>
  politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even<br>
  irony could be discerned.<br>
  <br>
  "Can one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times<br>
  like these if one has any feeling?" said Anna Pavlovna. "You are<br>
  staying the whole evening, I hope?"<br>
  <br>
  "And the fete at the English ambassador's? Today is Wednesday. I<br>
  must put in an appearance there," said the prince. "My daughter is<br>
  coming for me to take me there."<br>
  <br>
  "I thought today's fete had been canceled. I confess all these<br>
  festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome."<br>
  <br>
  "If they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would<br>
  have been put off," said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by<br>
  force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.<br>
  <br>
  "Don't tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novosiltsev's<br>
  dispatch? You know everything."<br>
  <br>
  "What can one say about it?" replied the prince in a cold,<br>
  listless tone. "What has been decided? They have decided that<br>
  Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to<br>
  burn ours."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Vasili always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a<br>
  stale part. Anna Pavlovna Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty<br>
  years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an<br>
  enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she<br>
  did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to<br>
  disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile<br>
  which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played<br>
  round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual<br>
  consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor<br>
  could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.<br>
  <br>
  In the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna Pavlovna<br>
  burst out:<br>
  <br>
  "Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don't understand<br>
  things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war.<br>
  She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious<br>
  sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is<br>
  the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to<br>
  perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble<br>
  that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and<br>
  crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than<br>
  ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must<br>
  avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely<br>
  on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot<br>
  understand the Emperor Alexander's loftiness of soul. She has<br>
  refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some<br>
  secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novosiltsev get? None.<br>
  The English have not understood and cannot understand the<br>
  self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only<br>
  desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And<br>
  what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has<br>
  always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe<br>
  is powerless before him.... And I don't believe a word that Hardenburg<br>
  says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a<br>
  trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored<br>
  monarch. He will save Europe!"<br>
  <br>
  She suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.<br>
  <br>
  "I think," said the prince with a smile, "that if you had been<br>
  sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the<br>
  King of Prussia's consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you<br>
  give me a cup of tea?"<br>
  <br>
  "In a moment. A propos," she added, becoming calm again, "I am<br>
  expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart,<br>
  who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of<br>
  the best French families. He is one of the genuine emigres, the good<br>
  ones. And also the Abbe Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He<br>
  has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?"<br>
  <br>
  "I shall be delighted to meet them," said the prince. "But tell me,"<br>
  he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred<br>
  to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive<br>
  of his visit, "is it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke<br>
  to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts<br>
  is a poor creature."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Vasili wished to obtain this post for his son, but others<br>
  were trying through the Dowager Empress Marya Fedorovna to secure it<br>
  for the baron.<br>
  <br>
  Anna Pavlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she<br>
  nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or<br>
  was pleased with.<br>
  <br>
  "Baron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her<br>
  sister," was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.<br>
  <br>
  As she named the Empress, Anna Pavlovna's face suddenly assumed an<br>
  expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with<br>
  sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious<br>
  patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron<br>
  Funke beaucoup d'estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.<br>
  <br>
  The prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the<br>
  womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna<br>
  Pavlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak he had done of<br>
  a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him,<br>
  so she said:<br>
  <br>
  "Now about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came<br>
  out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly<br>
  beautiful."<br>
  <br>
  The prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.<br>
  <br>
  "I often think," she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer<br>
  to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that<br>
  political and social topics were ended and the time had come for<br>
  intimate conversation- "I often think how unfairly sometimes the<br>
  joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid<br>
  children? I don't speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don't like<br>
  him," she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her<br>
  eyebrows. "Two such charming children. And really you appreciate<br>
  them less than anyone, and so you don't deserve to have them."<br>
  <br>
  And she smiled her ecstatic smile.<br>
  <br>
  "I can't help it," said the prince. "Lavater would have said I<br>
  lack the bump of paternity."<br>
  <br>
  "Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I<br>
  am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves" (and her<br>
  face assumed its melancholy expression), "he was mentioned at Her<br>
  Majesty's and you were pitied...."<br>
  <br>
  The prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly,<br>
  awaiting a reply. He frowned.<br>
  <br>
  "What would you have me do?" he said at last. "You know I did all<br>
  a father could for their education, and they have both turned out<br>
  fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active<br>
  one. That is the only difference between them." He said this smiling<br>
  in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles<br>
  round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse<br>
  and unpleasant.<br>
  <br>
  "And why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a<br>
  father there would be nothing I could reproach you with," said Anna<br>
  Pavlovna, looking up pensively.<br>
  <br>
  "I am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my<br>
  children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That<br>
  is how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!"<br>
  <br>
  He said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a<br>
  gesture. Anna Pavlovna meditated.<br>
  <br>
  "Have you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?"<br>
  she asked. "They say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and<br>
  though I don't feel that weakness in myself as yet,I know a little<br>
  person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of<br>
  yours, Princess Mary Bolkonskaya."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Vasili did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory<br>
  and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a<br>
  movement of the head that he was considering this information.<br>
  <br>
  "Do you know," he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad<br>
  current of his thoughts, "that Anatole is costing me forty thousand<br>
  rubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, "what will it be in<br>
  five years, if he goes on like this?" Presently he added: "That's what<br>
  we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?"<br>
  <br>
  "Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He<br>
  is the well-known Prince Bolkonski who had to retire from the army<br>
  under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the King of Prussia.' He is<br>
  very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very<br>
  unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise<br>
  Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kutuzov's and will be here<br>
  tonight."<br>
  <br>
  "Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, suddenly taking Anna<br>
  Pavlovna's hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange<br>
  that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-<br>
  slafe wigh an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She<br>
  is rich and of good family and that's all I want."<br>
  <br>
  And with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised<br>
  the maid of honor's hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and<br>
  fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.<br>
  <br>
  "Attendez," said Anna Pavlovna, reflecting, "I'll speak to Lise,<br>
  young Bolkonski's wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can<br>
  be arranged. It shall be on your family's behalf that I'll start my<br>
  apprenticeship as old maid."<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER II<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Anna Pavlovna's drawing room was gradually filling. The highest<br>
  Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age<br>
  and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged.<br>
  Prince Vasili's daughter, the beautiful Helene, came to take her<br>
  father to the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a ball dress and<br>
  her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess<br>
  Bolkonskaya, known as la femme la plus seduisante de Petersbourg,* was<br>
  also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being<br>
  pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small<br>
  receptions. Prince Vasili's son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart,<br>
  whom he introduced. The Abbe Morio and many others had also come.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  To each new arrival Anna Pavlovna said, "You have not yet seen my<br>
  aunt," or "You do not know my aunt?" and very gravely conducted him or<br>
  her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who<br>
  had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to<br>
  arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna<br>
  Pavlovna mentioned each one's name and then left them.<br>
  <br>
  Each visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom<br>
  not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of<br>
  them cared about; Anna Pavlovna observed these greetings with mournful<br>
  and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of<br>
  them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health<br>
  of Her Majesty, "who, thank God, was better today." And each<br>
  visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left<br>
  the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious<br>
  duty and did not return to her the whole evening.<br>
  <br>
  The young Princess Bolkonskaya had brought some work in a<br>
  gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a<br>
  delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her<br>
  teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming<br>
  when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always<br>
  the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect- the shortness<br>
  of her upper lip and her half-open mouth- seemed to be her own special<br>
  and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of<br>
  this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life<br>
  and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull<br>
  dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company<br>
  and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were<br>
  becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her,<br>
  and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her<br>
  white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that<br>
  day.<br>
  <br>
  The little princess went round the table with quick, short,<br>
  swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her<br>
  dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was<br>
  doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. "I have brought<br>
  my work," said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all<br>
  present. "Mind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick<br>
  on me," she added, turning to her hostess. "You wrote that it was to<br>
  be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed."<br>
  And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed,<br>
  dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.<br>
  <br>
  "Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone<br>
  else," replied Anna Pavlovna.<br>
  <br>
  "You know," said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in<br>
  French, turning to a general, "my husband is deserting me? He is going<br>
  to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?" she<br>
  added, addressing Prince Vasili, and without waiting for an answer she<br>
  turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful Helene.<br>
  <br>
  "What a delightful woman this little princess is!" said Prince<br>
  Vasili to Anna Pavlovna.<br>
  <br>
  One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with<br>
  close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable<br>
  at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout<br>
  young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bezukhov, a well-known<br>
  grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man<br>
  had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had<br>
  only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this<br>
  was his first appearance in society. Anna Pavlovna greeted him with<br>
  the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room.<br>
  But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and<br>
  fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the<br>
  place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was<br>
  certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety<br>
  could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant<br>
  and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else<br>
  in that drawing room.<br>
  <br>
  "It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor<br>
  invalid," said Anna Pavlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her<br>
  aunt as she conducted him to her.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look<br>
  round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to<br>
  the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate<br>
  acquaintance.<br>
  <br>
  Anna Pavlovna's alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the<br>
  aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty's health.<br>
  Anna Pavlovna in dismay detained him with the words: "Do you know<br>
  the Abbe Morio? He is a most interesting man."<br>
  <br>
  "Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very<br>
  interesting but hardly feasible."<br>
  <br>
  "You think so?" rejoined Anna Pavlovna in order to say something and<br>
  get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now<br>
  committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady<br>
  before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak<br>
  to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big<br>
  feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the<br>
  abbe's plan chimerical.<br>
  <br>
  "We will talk of it later," said Anna Pavlovna with a smile.<br>
  <br>
  And having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave,<br>
  she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch,<br>
  ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to<br>
  flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands<br>
  to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or<br>
  there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and<br>
  hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna<br>
  Pavlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a<br>
  too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the<br>
  conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid<br>
  these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an<br>
  anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to<br>
  listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to<br>
  another group whose center was the abbe.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna<br>
  Pavlovna's was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all<br>
  the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like<br>
  a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of<br>
  missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the<br>
  self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he<br>
  was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he<br>
  came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he<br>
  stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young<br>
  people are fond of doing.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER III<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Anna Pavlovna's reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed<br>
  steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt,<br>
  beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face<br>
  was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company<br>
  had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed<br>
  round the abbe. Another, of young people, was grouped round the<br>
  beautiful Princess Helene, Prince Vasili's daughter, and the little<br>
  Princess Bolkonskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump<br>
  for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna<br>
  Pavlovna.<br>
  <br>
  The vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and<br>
  polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out<br>
  of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in<br>
  which he found himself. Anna Pavlovna was obviously serving him up<br>
  as a treat to her guests. As a clever maitre d'hotel serves up as a<br>
  specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen<br>
  it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna Pavlovna served<br>
  up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abbe, as peculiarly<br>
  choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing<br>
  the murder of the Duc d'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc<br>
  d'Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were<br>
  particular reasons for Buonaparte's hatred of him.<br>
  <br>
  "Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte," said Anna Pavlovna,<br>
  with a pleasant feeling that there was something a la Louis XV in<br>
  the sound of that sentence: "Contez nous cela, Vicomte."<br>
  <br>
  The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness<br>
  to comply. Anna Pavlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone<br>
  to listen to his tale.<br>
  <br>
  "The vicomte knew the duc personally," whispered Anna Pavlovna to of<br>
  the guests. "The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur," said she to<br>
  another. "How evidently he belongs to the best society," said she to a<br>
  third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest<br>
  and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef<br>
  on a hot dish.<br>
  <br>
  The vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.<br>
  <br>
  "Come over here, Helene, dear," said Anna Pavlovna to the<br>
  beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of<br>
  another group.<br>
  <br>
  The princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with<br>
  which she had first entered the room- the smile of a perfectly<br>
  beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed<br>
  with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and<br>
  sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her,<br>
  not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously<br>
  allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and<br>
  shapely shoulders, back, and bosom- which in the fashion of those days<br>
  were very much exposed- and she seemed to bring the glamour of a<br>
  ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna Pavlovna. Helene was so<br>
  lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on<br>
  the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too<br>
  victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish<br>
  its effect.<br>
  <br>
  "How lovely!" said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted<br>
  his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something<br>
  extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also<br>
  with her unchanging smile.<br>
  <br>
  "Madame, I doubt my ability before such an audience," said he,<br>
  smilingly inclining his head.<br>
  <br>
  The princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and<br>
  considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the<br>
  story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful<br>
  round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her<br>
  still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond<br>
  necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and<br>
  whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna Pavlovna, at<br>
  once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor's<br>
  face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.<br>
  <br>
  The little princess had also left the tea table and followed Helene.<br>
  <br>
  "Wait a moment, I'll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking<br>
  of?" she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. "Fetch me my workbag."<br>
  <br>
  There was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking<br>
  merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in<br>
  her seat.<br>
  <br>
  "Now I am all right," she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she<br>
  took up her work.<br>
  <br>
  Prince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle<br>
  and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.<br>
  <br>
  Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary<br>
  resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that<br>
  in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features<br>
  were like his sister's, but while in her case everything was lit up by<br>
  a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation,<br>
  and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the<br>
  contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of<br>
  sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes,<br>
  nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace,<br>
  and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.<br>
  <br>
  "It's not going to be a ghost story?" said he, sitting down beside<br>
  the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this<br>
  instrument he could not begin to speak.<br>
  <br>
  "Why no, my dear fellow," said the astonished narrator, shrugging<br>
  his shoulders.<br>
  <br>
  "Because I hate ghost stories," said Prince Hippolyte in a tone<br>
  which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he<br>
  had uttered them.<br>
  <br>
  He spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be<br>
  sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was<br>
  dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of<br>
  cuisse de nymphe effrayee, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.<br>
  <br>
  The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then<br>
  current, to the effect that the Duc d'Enghien had gone secretly to<br>
  Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon<br>
  Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress' favors, and that in<br>
  his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits<br>
  to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc's mercy. The latter<br>
  spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by<br>
  death.<br>
  <br>
  The story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point<br>
  where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies<br>
  looked agitated.<br>
  <br>
  "Charming!" said Anna Pavlovna with an inquiring glance at the<br>
  little princess.<br>
  <br>
  "Charming!" whispered the little princess, sticking the needle<br>
  into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of<br>
  the story prevented her from going on with it.<br>
  <br>
  The vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully<br>
  prepared to continue, but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept a<br>
  watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he<br>
  was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abbe, so she hurried to<br>
  the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abbe<br>
  about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by<br>
  the young man's simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet<br>
  theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally,<br>
  which was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved.<br>
  <br>
  "The means are... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of<br>
  the people," the abbe was saying. "It is only necessary for one<br>
  powerful nation like Russia- barbaric as she is said to be- to place<br>
  herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its<br>
  object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would<br>
  save the world!"<br>
  <br>
  "But how are you to get that balance?" Pierre was beginning.<br>
  <br>
  At that moment Anna Pavlovna came up and, looking severely at<br>
  Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The<br>
  Italian's face instantly changed and assumed an offensively<br>
  affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing<br>
  with women.<br>
  <br>
  "I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the<br>
  society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have<br>
  had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think<br>
  of the climate," said he.<br>
  <br>
  Not letting the abbe and Pierre escape, Anna Pavlovna, the more<br>
  conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the<br>
  larger circle.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER IV<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Just then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew<br>
  Bolkonski, the little princess' husband. He was a very handsome<br>
  young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features.<br>
  Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet,<br>
  measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little<br>
  wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing<br>
  room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look<br>
  at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so<br>
  tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife.<br>
  He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome<br>
  face, kissed Anna Pavlovna's hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned<br>
  the whole company.<br>
  <br>
  "You are off to the war, Prince?" said Anna Pavlovna.<br>
  <br>
  "General Kutuzov," said Bolkonski, speaking French and stressing the<br>
  last syllable of the general's name like a Frenchman, "has been<br>
  pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp...."<br>
  <br>
  "And Lise, your wife?"<br>
  <br>
  "She will go to the country."<br>
  <br>
  "Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?"<br>
  <br>
  "Andre," said his wife, addressing her husband in the same<br>
  coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, "the vicomte has<br>
  been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!"<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who<br>
  from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with<br>
  glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he<br>
  looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance<br>
  with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre's beaming<br>
  face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.<br>
  <br>
  "There now!... So you, too, are in the great world?" said he to<br>
  Pierre.<br>
  <br>
  "I knew you would be here," replied Pierre. "I will come to supper<br>
  with you. May I?" he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the<br>
  vicomte who was continuing his story.<br>
  <br>
  "No, impossible!" said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre's<br>
  hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished<br>
  to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vasili and his<br>
  daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.<br>
  <br>
  "You must excuse me, dear Vicomte," said Prince Vasili to the<br>
  Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent<br>
  his rising. "This unfortunate fete at the ambassador's deprives me<br>
  of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to<br>
  leave your enchanting party," said he, turning to Anna Pavlovna.<br>
  <br>
  His daughter, Princess Helene, passed between the chairs, lightly<br>
  holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more<br>
  radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous,<br>
  almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.<br>
  <br>
  "Very lovely," said Prince Andrew.<br>
  <br>
  "Very," said Pierre.<br>
  <br>
  In passing Prince Vasili seized Pierre's hand and said to Anna<br>
  Pavlovna: "Educate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a<br>
  whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society.<br>
  Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever<br>
  women."<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Anna Pavlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew<br>
  his father to be a connection of Prince Vasili's. The elderly lady who<br>
  had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook<br>
  Prince Vasili in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had<br>
  assumed had left her kindly and tearworn face and it now expressed<br>
  only anxiety and fear.<br>
  <br>
  "How about my son Boris, Prince?" said she, hurrying after him<br>
  into the anteroom. "I can't remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me<br>
  what news I may take back to my poor boy."<br>
  <br>
  Although Prince Vasili listened reluctantly and not very politely to<br>
  the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an<br>
  ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might<br>
  not go away.<br>
  <br>
  "What would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he<br>
  would be transferred to the Guards at once?" said she.<br>
  <br>
  "Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can," answered<br>
  Prince Vasili, "but it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I<br>
  should advise you to appeal to Rumyantsev through Prince Golitsyn.<br>
  That would be the best way."<br>
  <br>
  The elderly lady was a Princess Drubetskaya, belonging to one of the<br>
  best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of<br>
  society had lost her former influential connections. She had now<br>
  come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her<br>
  only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vasili that she had<br>
  obtained an invitation to Anna Pavlovna's reception and had sat<br>
  listening to the vicomte's story. Prince Vasili's words frightened<br>
  her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a<br>
  moment; then she smiled again and dutched Prince Vasili's arm more<br>
  tightly.<br>
  <br>
  "Listen to me, Prince," said she. "I have never yet asked you for<br>
  anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my<br>
  father's friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God's sake to<br>
  do this for my son- and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,"<br>
  she added hurriedly. "No, don't be angry, but promise! I have asked<br>
  Golitsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always<br>
  were," she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.<br>
  <br>
  "Papa, we shall be late," said Princess Helene, turning her<br>
  beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she<br>
  stood waiting by the door.<br>
  <br>
  Influence in society, however, is a capital which has to be<br>
  economized if it is to last. Prince Vasili knew this, and having<br>
  once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him,<br>
  he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using<br>
  his influence. But in Princess Drubetskaya's case he felt, after her<br>
  second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded<br>
  him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the<br>
  first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners<br>
  that she was one of those women- mostly mothers- who, having once made<br>
  up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and<br>
  are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour<br>
  after hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved<br>
  him.<br>
  <br>
  "My dear Anna Mikhaylovna," said he with his usual familiarity and<br>
  weariness of tone, "it is almost impossible for me to do what you ask;<br>
  but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father's<br>
  memory, I will do the impossible- your son shall be transferred to the<br>
  Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?"<br>
  <br>
  "My dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you- I knew your<br>
  kindness!" He turned to go.<br>
  <br>
  "Wait- just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards..."<br>
  she faltered. "You are on good terms with Michael Ilarionovich<br>
  Kutuzov... recommend Boris to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at<br>
  rest, and then..."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Vasili smiled.<br>
  <br>
  "No, I won't promise that. You don't know how Kutuzov is pestered<br>
  since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that<br>
  all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as<br>
  adjutants."<br>
  <br>
  "No, but do promise! I won't let you go! My dear benefactor..."<br>
  <br>
  "Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before,<br>
  "we shall be late."<br>
  <br>
  "Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?"<br>
  <br>
  "Then tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?"<br>
  <br>
  "Certainly; but about Kutuzov, I don't promise."<br>
  <br>
  "Do promise, do promise, Vasili!" cried Anna Mikhaylovna as he went,<br>
  with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came<br>
  naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.<br>
  <br>
  Apparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit<br>
  employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone<br>
  her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She<br>
  returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again<br>
  pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her<br>
  task was accomplished.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER V<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  "And what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at<br>
  Milan?" asked Anna Pavlovna, "and of the comedy of the people of Genoa<br>
  and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and<br>
  Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions<br>
  of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one's head whirl! It is<br>
  as if the whole world had gone crazy."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew looked Anna Pavlovna straight in the face with a<br>
  sarcastic smile.<br>
  <br>
  "'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touche!'* They say he was very<br>
  fine when he said that," he remarked, repeating the words in<br>
  Italian: "'Dio mi l'ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!'"<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *God has given it to me, let him who touches it beware!<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  "I hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run<br>
  over," Anna Pavlovna continued. "The sovereigns will not be able to<br>
  endure this man who is a menace to everything."<br>
  <br>
  "The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia," said the vicomte, polite<br>
  but hopeless: "The sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis<br>
  XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!" and he<br>
  became more animated. "And believe me, they are reaping the reward<br>
  of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they<br>
  are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper."<br>
  <br>
  And sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.<br>
  <br>
  Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time<br>
  through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the<br>
  little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Conde<br>
  coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much<br>
  gravity as if she had asked him to do it.<br>
  <br>
  "Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d' azur- maison Conde," said<br>
  he.<br>
  <br>
  The princess listened, smiling.<br>
  <br>
  "If Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer," the<br>
  vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which<br>
  he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others<br>
  but follows the current of his own thoughts, "things will have gone<br>
  too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French<br>
  society- I mean good French society- will have been forever destroyed,<br>
  and then..."<br>
  <br>
  He shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to<br>
  make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna Pavlovna,<br>
  who had him under observation, interrupted:<br>
  <br>
  "The Emperor Alexander," said she, with the melancholy which<br>
  always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family,<br>
  "has declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to<br>
  choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from<br>
  the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the<br>
  arms of its rightful king," she concluded, trying to be amiable to the<br>
  royalist emigrant.<br>
  <br>
  "That is doubtful," said Prince Andrew. "Monsieur le Vicomte quite<br>
  rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it<br>
  will be difficult to return to the old regime."<br>
  <br>
  "From what I have heard," said Pierre, blushing and breaking into<br>
  the conversation, "almost all the aristocracy has already gone over to<br>
  Bonaparte's side."<br>
  <br>
  "It is the Buonapartists who say that," replied the vicomte<br>
  without looking at Pierre. "At the present time it is difficult to<br>
  know the real state of French public opinion.<br>
  <br>
  "Bonaparte has said so," remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic<br>
  smile.<br>
  <br>
  It was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his<br>
  remarks at him, though without looking at him.<br>
  <br>
  "'I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,'"<br>
  Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting<br>
  Napoleon's words. "'I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.' I<br>
  do not know how far he was justified in saying so."<br>
  <br>
  "Not in the least," replied the vicomte. "After the murder of the<br>
  duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some<br>
  people," he went on, turning to Anna Pavlovna, "he ever was a hero,<br>
  after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and<br>
  one hero less on earth."<br>
  <br>
  Before Anna Pavlovna and the others had time to smile their<br>
  appreciation of the vicomte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the<br>
  conversation, and though Anna Pavlovna felt sure he would say<br>
  something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.<br>
  <br>
  "The execution of the Duc d'Enghien," declared Monsieur Pierre, "was<br>
  a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed<br>
  greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole<br>
  responsibility of that deed."<br>
  <br>
  "Dieu! Mon Dieu!" muttered Anna Pavlovna in a terrified whisper.<br>
  <br>
  "What, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows<br>
  greatness of soul?" said the little princess, smiling and drawing<br>
  her work nearer to her.<br>
  <br>
  "Oh! Oh!" exclaimed several voices.<br>
  <br>
  "Capital!" said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping<br>
  his knee with the palm of his hand.<br>
  <br>
  The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at<br>
  his audience over his spectacles and continued.<br>
  <br>
  "I say so," he continued desperately, "because the Bourbons fled<br>
  from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon<br>
  alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general<br>
  good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man's life."<br>
  <br>
  "Won't you come over to the other table?" suggested Anna Pavlovna.<br>
  <br>
  But Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.<br>
  <br>
  "No," cried he, becoming more and more eager, "Napoleon is great<br>
  because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses,<br>
  preserved all that was good in it- equality of citizenship and freedom<br>
  of speech and of the press- and only for that reason did he obtain<br>
  power."<br>
  <br>
  "Yes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to<br>
  commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have<br>
  called him a great man," remarked the vicomte.<br>
  <br>
  "He could not do that. The people only gave him power that he<br>
  might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a<br>
  great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!" continued Monsieur<br>
  Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his<br>
  extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.<br>
  <br>
  "What? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that...<br>
  But won't you come to this other table?" repeated Anna Pavlovna.<br>
  <br>
  "Rousseau's Contrat social," said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.<br>
  <br>
  "I am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas."<br>
  <br>
  "Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide," again interjected<br>
  an ironical voice.<br>
  <br>
  "Those were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most<br>
  important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation<br>
  from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas<br>
  Napoleon has retained in full force."<br>
  <br>
  "Liberty and equality," said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at<br>
  last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words<br>
  were, "high-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who<br>
  does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached<br>
  liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier?<br>
  On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the<br>
  vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment<br>
  of Pierre's outburst Anna Pavlovna, despite her social experience, was<br>
  horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacrilegious words had<br>
  not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was<br>
  impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the<br>
  vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.<br>
  <br>
  "But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, "how do you explain the<br>
  fact of a great man executing a duc- or even an ordinary man who- is<br>
  innocent and untried?"<br>
  <br>
  "I should like," said the vicomte, "to ask how monsieur explains the<br>
  18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at<br>
  all like the conduct of a great man!"<br>
  <br>
  "And the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!" said the<br>
  little princess, shrugging her shoulders.<br>
  <br>
  "He's a low fellow, say what you will," remarked Prince Hippolyte.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled.<br>
  His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled,<br>
  his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by<br>
  another- a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed<br>
  to ask forgiveness.<br>
  <br>
  The vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly<br>
  that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested.<br>
  All were silent.<br>
  <br>
  "How do you expect him to answer you all at once?" said Prince<br>
  Andrew. "Besides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish<br>
  between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor.<br>
  So it seems to me."<br>
  <br>
  "Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of<br>
  this reinforcement.<br>
  <br>
  "One must admit," continued Prince Andrew, "that Napoleon as a man<br>
  was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa<br>
  where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but... but there are<br>
  other acts which it is difficult to justify."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness<br>
  of Pierre's remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time<br>
  to go.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to<br>
  attend, and asking them all to be seated began:<br>
  <br>
  "I was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to<br>
  it. Excuse me, Vicomte- I must tell it in Russian or the point will be<br>
  lost...." And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian<br>
  as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia.<br>
  Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their<br>
  attention to his story.<br>
  <br>
  "There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She<br>
  must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was<br>
  her taste. And she had a lady's maid, also big. She said..."<br>
  <br>
  Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with<br>
  difficulty.<br>
  <br>
  "She said... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the maid, 'put on a<br>
  livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some<br>
  calls.'"<br>
  <br>
  Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long<br>
  before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the<br>
  narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna<br>
  Pavlovna, did however smile.<br>
  <br>
  "She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat<br>
  and her long hair came down...." Here he could contain himself no<br>
  longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: "And the whole world<br>
  knew...."<br>
  <br>
  And so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had<br>
  told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pavlovna<br>
  and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's social tact in so<br>
  agreeably ending Pierre's unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the<br>
  anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about<br>
  the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom,<br>
  and when and where.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER VI<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Having thanked Anna Pavlovna for her charming soiree, the guests<br>
  began to take their leave.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with<br>
  huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, to enter a<br>
  drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say<br>
  something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he<br>
  was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his<br>
  own, the general's three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the<br>
  plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his<br>
  absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it<br>
  was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression.<br>
  Anna Pavlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that<br>
  expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: "I hope to<br>
  see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my<br>
  dear Monsieur Pierre."<br>
  <br>
  When she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again<br>
  everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, "Opinions<br>
  are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am."<br>
  And everyone, including Anna Pavlovna, felt this.<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders<br>
  to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened<br>
  indifferently to his wife's chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also<br>
  come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty,<br>
  pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.<br>
  <br>
  "Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold," said the little<br>
  princess, taking leave of Anna Pavlovna. "It is settled," she added in<br>
  a low voice.<br>
  <br>
  Anna Pavlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match<br>
  she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess'<br>
  sister-in-law.<br>
  <br>
  "I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pavlovna, also in a low tone.<br>
  "Write to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au<br>
  revoir!"- and she left the hall.<br>
  <br>
  Prince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his<br>
  face close to her, began to whisper something.<br>
  <br>
  Two footmen, the princess' and his own, stood holding a shawl and<br>
  a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to<br>
  the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of<br>
  understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as<br>
  usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.<br>
  <br>
  "I am very glad I did not go to the ambassador's," said Prince<br>
  Hippolyte "-so dull-. It has been a delightful evening, has it not?<br>
  Delightful!"<br>
  <br>
  "They say the ball will be very good," replied the princess, drawing<br>
  up her downy little lip. "All the pretty women in society will be<br>
  there."<br>
  <br>
  "Not all, for you will not be there; not all," said Prince Hippolyte<br>
  smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he<br>
  even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either<br>
  from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after<br>
  the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long<br>
  time, as though embracing her.<br>
  <br>
  Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at<br>
  her husband. Prince Andrew's eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did<br>
  he seem.<br>
  <br>
  "Are you ready?" he asked his wife, looking past her.<br>
  <br>
  Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest<br>
  fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out<br>
  into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into<br>
  the carriage.<br>
  <br>
  "Princesse, au revoir," cried he, stumbling with his tongue as<br>
  well as with his feet.<br>
  <br>
  The princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the<br>
  dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince<br>
  Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone's way.<br>
  <br>
  "Allow me, sir," said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold,<br>
  disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.<br>
  <br>
  "I am expecting you, Pierre," said the same voice, but gently and<br>
  affectionately.<br>
  <br>
  The postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte<br>
  laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte<br>
  whom he had promised to take home.<br>
  <br>
  "Well, mon cher," said the vicomte, having seated himself beside<br>
  Hippolyte in the carriage, "your little princess is very nice, very<br>
  nice indeed, quite French," and he kissed the tips of his fingers.<br>
  Hippolyte burst out laughing.<br>
  <br>
  "Do you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,"<br>
  continued the vicomte. "I pity the poor husband, that little officer<br>
  who gives himself the airs of a monarch."<br>
  <br>
  Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, "And you<br>
  were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One<br>
  has to know how to deal with them."<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Pierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew's study like<br>
  one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa,<br>
  took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was<br>
  Caesar's Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it<br>
  in the middle.<br>
  <br>
  "What have you done to Mlle Scherer? She will be quite ill now,"<br>
  said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white<br>
  hands.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his<br>
  eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.<br>
  <br>
  "That abbe is very interesting but he does not see the thing in<br>
  the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but- I<br>
  do not know how to express it... not by a balance of political<br>
  power...."<br>
  <br>
  It was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such<br>
  abstract conversation.<br>
  <br>
  "One can't everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have you<br>
  at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a<br>
  diplomatist?" asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.<br>
  <br>
  "Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either the one or the<br>
  other."<br>
  <br>
  "But you must decide on something! Your father expects it."<br>
  <br>
  Pierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abbe as tutor,<br>
  and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow<br>
  his father dismissed the abbe and said to the young man, "Now go to<br>
  Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to<br>
  anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vasili, and here is money.<br>
  Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything." Pierre<br>
  had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not<br>
  decided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was<br>
  speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.<br>
  <br>
  "But he must be a Freemason," said he, referring to the abbe whom he<br>
  had met that evening.<br>
  <br>
  "That is all nonsense." Prince Andrew again interrupted him, "let us<br>
  talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?"<br>
  <br>
  "No, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to<br>
  tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for<br>
  freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the<br>
  army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in<br>
  the world is not right."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre's childish<br>
  words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to<br>
  such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any<br>
  other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this naive question.<br>
  <br>
  "If no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no<br>
  wars," he said.<br>
  <br>
  "And that would be splendid," said Pierre.<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew smiled ironically.<br>
  <br>
  "Very likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about..."<br>
  <br>
  "Well, why are you going to the war?" asked Pierre.<br>
  <br>
  "What for? I don't know. I must. Besides that I am going..." He<br>
  paused. "I am going because the life I am leading here does not suit<br>
  me!"<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER VII<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The rustle of a woman's dress was heard in the next room. Prince<br>
  Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it<br>
  had had in Anna Pavlovna's drawing room. Pierre removed his feet<br>
  from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a<br>
  house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose<br>
  and politely placed a chair for her.<br>
  <br>
  "How is it," she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly<br>
  and fussily in the easy chair, "how is it Annette never got married?<br>
  How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for<br>
  saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative<br>
  fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!"<br>
  <br>
  "And I am still arguing with your husband. I can't understand why he<br>
  wants to go to the war," replied Pierre, addressing the princess<br>
  with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their<br>
  intercourse with young women.<br>
  <br>
  The princess started. Evidently Pierre's words touched her to the<br>
  quick.<br>
  <br>
  "Ah, that is just what I tell him!" said she. "I don't understand<br>
  it; I don't in the least understand why men can't live without wars.<br>
  How is it that we women don't want anything of the kind, don't need<br>
  it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is<br>
  Uncle's aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well<br>
  known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the<br>
  Apraksins' I heard a lady asking, 'Is that the famous Prince<br>
  Andrew?' I did indeed." She laughed. "He is so well received<br>
  everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You<br>
  know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were<br>
  speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?"<br>
  <br>
  Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the<br>
  conversation, gave no reply.<br>
  <br>
  "When are you starting?" he asked.<br>
  <br>
  "Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! I won't hear it spoken of,"<br>
  said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had<br>
  spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly<br>
  ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member.<br>
  "Today when I remembered that all these delightful associations must<br>
  be broken off... and then you know, Andre..." (she looked<br>
  significantly at her husband) "I'm afraid, I'm afraid!" she whispered,<br>
  and a shudder ran down her back.<br>
  <br>
  Her husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone<br>
  besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a<br>
  tone of frigid politeness.<br>
  <br>
  "What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don't understand," said he.<br>
  <br>
  "There, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a<br>
  whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up<br>
  alone in the country."<br>
  <br>
  "With my father and sister, remember," said Prince Andrew gently.<br>
  <br>
  "Alone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to<br>
  be afraid."<br>
  <br>
  Her tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a<br>
  joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if<br>
  she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though<br>
  the gist of the matter lay in that.<br>
  <br>
  "I still can't understand what you are afraid of," said Prince<br>
  Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.<br>
  <br>
  The princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.<br>
  <br>
  "No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have..."<br>
  <br>
  "Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," said Prince Andrew.<br>
  "You had better go."<br>
  <br>
  The princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip<br>
  quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about<br>
  the room.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre looked over his spectacles with naive surprise, now at him<br>
  and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.<br>
  <br>
  "Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?" exclaimed the little<br>
  princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a<br>
  tearful grimace. "I have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you<br>
  have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the<br>
  war and have no pity for me. Why is it?"<br>
  <br>
  "Lise!" was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an<br>
  entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself<br>
  regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:<br>
  <br>
  "You treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you<br>
  behave like that six months ago?"<br>
  <br>
  "Lise, I beg you to desist," said Prince Andrew still more<br>
  emphatically.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened<br>
  to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to<br>
  bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.<br>
  <br>
  "Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because... I assure you<br>
  I myself have experienced... and so... because... No, excuse me! An<br>
  outsider is out of place here... No, don't distress yourself...<br>
  Good-by!"<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew caught him by the hand.<br>
  <br>
  "No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of<br>
  the pleasure of spending the evening with you."<br>
  <br>
  "No, he thinks only of himself," muttered the princess without<br>
  restraining her angry tears.<br>
  <br>
  "Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch<br>
  which indicates that patience is exhausted.<br>
  <br>
  Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess' pretty<br>
  face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful<br>
  eyes glanced askance at her husband's face, and her own assumed the<br>
  timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags<br>
  its drooping tail.<br>
  <br>
  "Mon Dieu, mon Dieu!" she muttered, and lifting her dress with one<br>
  hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.<br>
  <br>
  "Good night, Lise," said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand<br>
  as he would have done to a stranger.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER VIII<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  The friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre<br>
  continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his<br>
  forehead with his small hand.<br>
  <br>
  "Let us go and have supper," he said with a sigh, going to the door.<br>
  <br>
  They entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining<br>
  room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and<br>
  glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the<br>
  newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his<br>
  elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as<br>
  Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk- as one who<br>
  has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak<br>
  out.<br>
  <br>
  "Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's my advice: never marry<br>
  till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable<br>
  of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and<br>
  have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and<br>
  irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing- or<br>
  all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be<br>
  wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with such surprise.<br>
  If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you<br>
  will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed<br>
  except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with<br>
  a court lackey and an idiot!... But what's the good?..." and he<br>
  waved his arm.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different<br>
  and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at<br>
  his friend in amazement.<br>
  <br>
  "My wife," continued Prince Andrew, "is an excellent woman, one of<br>
  those rare women with whom a man's honor is safe; but, O God, what<br>
  would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one<br>
  to whom I mention this, because I like you."<br>
  <br>
  As he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolkonski<br>
  who had lolled in Anna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with half-closed<br>
  eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his<br>
  thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in<br>
  which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with<br>
  brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at<br>
  ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of<br>
  almost morbid irritation.<br>
  <br>
  "You don't understand why I say this," he continued, "but it is<br>
  the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career," said<br>
  he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), "but Bonaparte when he<br>
  worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had<br>
  nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself<br>
  up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And<br>
  all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and<br>
  torments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and<br>
  triviality- these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I<br>
  am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know<br>
  nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic<br>
  wit," continued Prince Andrew, "and at Anna Pavlovna's they listen<br>
  to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and<br>
  those women... If you only knew what those society women are, and<br>
  women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial<br>
  in everything- that's what women are when you see them in their true<br>
  colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were<br>
  something in them, but there's nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don't<br>
  marry, my dear fellow; don't marry!" concluded Prince Andrew.<br>
  <br>
  "It seems funny to me," said Pierre, "that you, you should<br>
  consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have<br>
  everything before you, everything. And you..."<br>
  <br>
  He did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he<br>
  thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.<br>
  <br>
  "How can he talk like that?" thought Pierre. He considered his<br>
  friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the<br>
  highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which<br>
  might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always<br>
  astonished at Prince Andrew's calm manner of treating everybody, his<br>
  extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything,<br>
  knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all<br>
  at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck<br>
  by Andrew's lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he<br>
  himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a<br>
  defect but as a sign of strength.<br>
  <br>
  Even in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life,<br>
  praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary<br>
  to wheels that they may run smoothly.<br>
  <br>
  "My part is played out," said Prince Andrew. "What's the use of<br>
  talking about me? Let us talk about you," he added after a silence,<br>
  smiling at his reassuring thoughts.<br>
  <br>
  That smile was immediately reflected on Pierre's face.<br>
  <br>
  "But what is there to say about me?" said Pierre, his face<br>
  relaxing into a careless, merry smile. "What am I? An illegitimate<br>
  son!" He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a<br>
  great effort to say this. "Without a name and without means... And<br>
  it really..." But he did not say what "it really" was. "For the<br>
  present I am free and am all right. Only I haven't the least idea what<br>
  I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously."<br>
  <br>
  Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance- friendly and<br>
  affectionate as it was- expressed a sense of his own superiority.<br>
  <br>
  "I am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among<br>
  our whole set. Yes, you're all right! Choose what you will; it's all<br>
  the same. You'll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up<br>
  visiting those Kuragins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so<br>
  badly- all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!"<br>
  <br>
  "What would you have, my dear fellow?" answered Pierre, shrugging<br>
  his shoulders. "Women, my dear fellow; women!"<br>
  <br>
  "I don't understand it," replied Prince Andrew. "Women who are comme<br>
  il faut, that's a different matter; but the Kuragins' set of women,<br>
  'women and wine' I don't understand!"<br>
  <br>
  Pierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kuragin's and sharing the<br>
  dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to<br>
  reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew's sister.<br>
  <br>
  "Do you know?" said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy<br>
  thought, "seriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading<br>
  such a life I can't decide or think properly about anything. One's<br>
  head aches, and one spends all one's money. He asked me for tonight,<br>
  but I won't go."<br>
  <br>
  "You give me your word of honor not to go?"<br>
  <br>
  "On my honor!"<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER IX<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  It was past one o'clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a<br>
  cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending<br>
  to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more<br>
  he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was<br>
  light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed<br>
  more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre<br>
  remembered that Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual set for<br>
  cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout,<br>
  finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.<br>
  <br>
  "I should like to go to Kuragin's," thought he.<br>
  <br>
  But he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go<br>
  there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so<br>
  passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so<br>
  accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately<br>
  occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account,<br>
  because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to<br>
  come to his gathering; "besides," thought he, "all such 'words of<br>
  honor' are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if<br>
  one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so<br>
  extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all<br>
  the same!" Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort,<br>
  nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kuragin's.<br>
  <br>
  Reaching the large house near the Horse Guards' barracks, in which<br>
  Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the<br>
  stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the<br>
  anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there<br>
  was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the<br>
  distance.<br>
  <br>
  Cards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet<br>
  dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in<br>
  which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw<br>
  him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the<br>
  third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices,<br>
  the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine<br>
  young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others<br>
  were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and<br>
  trying to set him at the others.<br>
  <br>
  "I bet a hundred on Stevens!" shouted one.<br>
  <br>
  "Mind, no holding on!" cried another.<br>
  <br>
  "I bet on Dolokhov!" cried a third. "Kuragin, you part our hands."<br>
  <br>
  "There, leave Bruin alone; here's a bet on."<br>
  <br>
  "At one draught, or he loses!" shouted a fourth.<br>
  <br>
  "Jacob, bring a bottle!" shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow<br>
  who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine<br>
  linen shirt unfastened in front. "Wait a bit, you fellows.... Here<br>
  is Petya! Good man!" cried he, addressing Pierre.<br>
  <br>
  Another voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes,<br>
  particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober<br>
  ring, cried from the window: "Come here; part the bets!" This was<br>
  Dolokhov, an officer of the Semenov regiment, a notorious gambler<br>
  and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about<br>
  him merrily.<br>
  <br>
  "I don't understand. What's it all about?"<br>
  <br>
  "Wait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here," said Anatole,<br>
  taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.<br>
  <br>
  "First of all you must drink!"<br>
  <br>
  Pierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows<br>
  at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and<br>
  listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre's glass<br>
  while explaining that Dolokhov was betting with Stevens, an English<br>
  naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the<br>
  outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.<br>
  <br>
  "Go on, you must drink it all," said Anatole, giving Pierre the last<br>
  glass, "or I won't let you go!"<br>
  <br>
  "No, I won't," said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to<br>
  the window.<br>
  <br>
  Dolokhov was holding the Englishman's hand and clearly and<br>
  distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself<br>
  particularly to Anatole and Pierre.<br>
  <br>
  Dolokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue<br>
  eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore<br>
  no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face,<br>
  was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely<br>
  curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed<br>
  firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles<br>
  played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this,<br>
  together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes,<br>
  produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face.<br>
  Dolokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though<br>
  Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, Dolokhov lived with him and<br>
  had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including<br>
  Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. Dolokhov<br>
  could play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank,<br>
  he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kuragin and Dolokhov were at<br>
  that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.<br>
  <br>
  The bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented<br>
  anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two<br>
  footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions<br>
  and shouts of the gentlemen around.<br>
  <br>
  Anatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted<br>
  to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame,<br>
  but could not move it. He smashed a pane.<br>
  <br>
  "You have a try, Hercules," said he, turning to Pierre.<br>
  <br>
  Pierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame<br>
  out with a crash.<br>
  <br>
  "Take it right out, or they'll think I'm holding on," said Dolokhov.<br>
  <br>
  "Is the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?" said Anatole.<br>
  <br>
  "First-rate," said Pierre, looking at Dolokhov, who with a bottle of<br>
  rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of<br>
  the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.<br>
  <br>
  Dolokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the<br>
  window sill. "Listen!" cried he, standing there and addressing those<br>
  in the room. All were silent.<br>
  <br>
  "I bet fifty imperials"- he spoke French that the Englishman might<br>
  understand him, but he did, not speak it very well- "I bet fifty<br>
  imperials... or do you wish to make it a hundred?" added he,<br>
  addressing the Englishman.<br>
  <br>
  "No, fifty," replied the latter.<br>
  <br>
  "All right. Fifty imperials... that I will drink a whole bottle of<br>
  rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on<br>
  this spot" (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the<br>
  window) "and without holding on to anything. Is that right?"<br>
  <br>
  "Quite right," said the Englishman.<br>
  <br>
  Anatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the<br>
  buttons of his coat and looking down at him- the Englishman was short-<br>
  began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.<br>
  <br>
  "Wait!" cried Dolokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill<br>
  to attract attention. "Wait a bit, Kuragin. Listen! If anyone else<br>
  does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?"<br>
  <br>
  The Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to<br>
  accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and<br>
  though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on<br>
  translating Dolokhov's words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar<br>
  of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the<br>
  window sill, leaned over, and looked down.<br>
  <br>
  "Oh! Oh! Oh!" he muttered, looking down from the window at the<br>
  stones of the pavement.<br>
  <br>
  "Shut up!" cried Dolokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad<br>
  jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.<br>
  <br>
  Placing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it<br>
  easily, Dolokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and<br>
  lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he<br>
  adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the<br>
  right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought<br>
  two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was<br>
  already quite light. Dolokhov's back in his white shirt, and his curly<br>
  head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the<br>
  Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older<br>
  than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and<br>
  angry look and wanted to seize hold of Dolokhov's shirt.<br>
  <br>
  "I say, this is folly! He'll be killed," said this more sensible<br>
  man.<br>
  <br>
  Anatole stopped him.<br>
  <br>
  "Don't touch him! You'll startle him and then he'll be killed.<br>
  Eh?... What then?... Eh?"<br>
  <br>
  Dolokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands,<br>
  arranged himself on his seat.<br>
  <br>
  "If anyone comes meddling again," said he, emitting the words<br>
  separately through his thin compressed lips, "I will throw him down<br>
  there. Now then!"<br>
  <br>
  Saying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the<br>
  bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised<br>
  his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped<br>
  to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without<br>
  taking his eyes from the window and from Dolokhov's back. Anatole<br>
  stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways,<br>
  pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran<br>
  to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to<br>
  the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade<br>
  though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still.<br>
  Pierre took his hands from his eyes. Dolokhov still sat in the same<br>
  position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair<br>
  touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted<br>
  higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was<br>
  emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting<br>
  yet further back. "Why is it so long?" thought Pierre. It seemed to<br>
  him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly Dolokhov made<br>
  a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously;<br>
  this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the<br>
  sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered<br>
  still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the<br>
  window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered<br>
  his eyes and thought he would never never them again. Suddenly he<br>
  was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: Dolokhov was standing on<br>
  the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.<br>
  <br>
  "It's empty."<br>
  <br>
  He threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly.<br>
  Dolokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.<br>
  <br>
  "Well done!... Fine fellow!... There's a bet for you!... Devil<br>
  take you!" came from different sides.<br>
  <br>
  The Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the<br>
  money. Dolokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon<br>
  the window sill.<br>
  <br>
  "Gentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I'll do the same thing!" he<br>
  suddenly cried. "Even without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a<br>
  bottle. I'll do it.... Bring a bottle!"<br>
  <br>
  "Let him do it, let him do it," said Dolokhov, smiling.<br>
  <br>
  "What next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why,<br>
  you go giddy even on a staircase," exclaimed several voices.<br>
  <br>
  "I'll drink it! Let's have a bottle of rum!" shouted Pierre, banging<br>
  the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb<br>
  out of the window.<br>
  <br>
  They seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone<br>
  who touched him was sent flying.<br>
  <br>
  "No, you'll never manage him that way," said Anatole. "Wait a bit<br>
  and I'll get round him.... Listen! I'll take your bet tomorrow, but<br>
  now we are all going to -'s."<br>
  <br>
  "Come on then," cried Pierre. "Come on!... And we'll take Bruin with<br>
  us."<br>
  <br>
  And he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the<br>
  ground, and began dancing round the room with it.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER X<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Prince Vasili kept the promise he had given to Princess<br>
  Drubetskaya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Boris on<br>
  the evening of Anna Pavlovna's soiree. The matter was mentioned to the<br>
  Emperor, an exception made, and Boris transferred into the regiment of<br>
  Semenov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no<br>
  appointment to Kutuzov's staff despite all Anna Mikhaylovna's<br>
  endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna Pavlovna's reception Anna<br>
  Mikhaylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich<br>
  relations, the Rostovs, with whom she stayed when in the town and<br>
  where her darling Bory, who had only just entered a regiment<br>
  of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a<br>
  cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a<br>
  time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August,<br>
  and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join<br>
  them on the march to Radzivilov.<br>
  <br>
  It was St. Natalia's day and the name day of two of the Rostovs- the<br>
  mother and the youngest daughter- both named Nataly. Ever since the<br>
  morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going<br>
  continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rostova's big house<br>
  on the Povarskaya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself<br>
  and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing-room with the<br>
  visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one<br>
  another in relays.<br>
  <br>
  The countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental<br>
  type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing- she had had<br>
  twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness,<br>
  gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna<br>
  Mikhaylovna Drubetskaya, who as a member of the household was also<br>
  seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the<br>
  visitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not<br>
  considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The<br>
  count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.<br>
  <br>
  "I am very, very grateful to you, mon cher," or "ma chere"- he<br>
  called everyone without exception and without the slightest<br>
  variation in his tone, "my dear," whether they were above or below him<br>
  in rank- "I thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose<br>
  name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be<br>
  offended, ma chere! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come,<br>
  mon cher!" These words he repeated to everyone without exception or<br>
  variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful,<br>
  clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same<br>
  quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned<br>
  to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair<br>
  toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his<br>
  hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how<br>
  to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the<br>
  weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and<br>
  sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a<br>
  man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see<br>
  some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald<br>
  patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the<br>
  anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the<br>
  large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty<br>
  people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and<br>
  china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would<br>
  call Dmitri Vasilevich, a man of good family and the manager of all<br>
  his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table<br>
  would say: "Well, Dmitri, you'll see that things are all as they<br>
  should be? That's right! The great thing is the serving, that's it."<br>
  And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.<br>
  <br>
  "Marya Lvovna Karagina and her daughter!" announced the countess'<br>
  gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The<br>
  countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with<br>
  her husband's portrait on it.<br>
  <br>
  "I'm quite worn out by these callers. However, I'll see her and no<br>
  more. She is so affected. Ask her in," she said to the footman in a<br>
  sad voice, as if saying: "Very well, finish me off."<br>
  <br>
  A tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling<br>
  daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.<br>
  <br>
  "Dear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child...<br>
  at the Razumovski's ball... and Countess Apraksina... I was so<br>
  delighted..." came the sounds of animated feminine voices,<br>
  interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and<br>
  the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which<br>
  last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of<br>
  dresses and say, "I am so delighted... Mamma's health... and<br>
  Countess Apraksina... and then, again rustling, pass into the<br>
  anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation<br>
  was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and<br>
  celebrated beau of Catherine's day, Count Bezukhov, and about his<br>
  illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna<br>
  Pavlovna's reception.<br>
  <br>
  "I am so sorry for the poor count," said the visitor. "He is in such<br>
  bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill<br>
  him!"<br>
  <br>
  "What is that?" asked the countess as if she did not know what the<br>
  visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of<br>
  Count Bezukhov's distress some fifteen times.<br>
  <br>
  "That's what comes of a modern education," exclaimed the visitor.<br>
  "It seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as<br>
  he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible<br>
  things that he has been expelled by the police."<br>
  <br>
  "You don't say so!" replied the countess.<br>
  <br>
  "He chose his friends badly," interposed Anna Mikhaylovna. "Prince<br>
  Vasili's son, he, and a certain Dolokhov have, it is said, been up<br>
  to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it.<br>
  Dolokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bezukhov's son sent back<br>
  to Moscow. Anatole Kuragin's father managed somehow to get his son's<br>
  affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg."<br>
  <br>
  "But what have they been up to?" asked the countess.<br>
  <br>
  "They are regular brigands, especially Dolokhov," replied the<br>
  visitor. "He is a son of Marya Ivanovna Dolokhova, such a worthy<br>
  woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear<br>
  somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some<br>
  actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men<br>
  do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear<br>
  into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the<br>
  policeman on his back!"<br>
  <br>
  "What a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!" shouted<br>
  the count, dying with laughter.<br>
  <br>
  "Oh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?"<br>
  <br>
  Yet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.<br>
  <br>
  "It was all they could do to rescue the poor man," continued the<br>
  visitor. "And to think it is Cyril Vladimirovich Bezukhov's son who<br>
  amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so<br>
  well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has<br>
  done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in<br>
  spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite<br>
  declined: I have my daughters to consider."<br>
  <br>
  "Why do you say this young man is so rich?" asked the countess,<br>
  turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of<br>
  inattention. "His children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also<br>
  is illegitimate."<br>
  <br>
  The visitor made a gesture with her hand.<br>
  <br>
  "I should think he has a score of them."<br>
  <br>
  Princess Anna Mikhaylovna intervened in the conversation,<br>
  evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went<br>
  on in society.<br>
  <br>
  "The fact of the matter is," said she significantly, and also in a<br>
  half whisper, "everyone knows Count Cyril's reputation.... He has lost<br>
  count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite."<br>
  <br>
  "How handsome the old man still was only a year ago!" remarked the<br>
  countess. "I have never seen a handsomer man."<br>
  <br>
  "He is very much altered now," said Anna Mikhaylovna. "Well, as I<br>
  was saying, Prince Vasili is the next heir through his wife, but the<br>
  count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to<br>
  the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death- and he is<br>
  so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from<br>
  Petersburg- no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune,<br>
  Pierre or Prince Vasili. Forty thousand serfs and millions of<br>
  rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vasili told me himself.<br>
  Besides, Cyril Vladimirovich is my mother's second cousin. He's also<br>
  my Bory's godfather," she added, as if she attached no importance at<br>
  all to the fact.<br>
  <br>
  "Prince Vasili arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on<br>
  some inspection business," remarked the visitor.<br>
  <br>
  "Yes, but between ourselves," said the princess, that is a<br>
  pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vladimirovich,<br>
  hearing how ill he is."<br>
  <br>
  "But do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke," said the count;<br>
  and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to<br>
  the young ladies. "I can just imagine what a funny figure that<br>
  policeman cut!"<br>
  <br>
  And as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly<br>
  form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who<br>
  always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. "So do come and dine<br>
  with us!" he said.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  CHAPTER XI<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Silence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably,<br>
  but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they<br>
  now rose and took their leave. The visitor's daughter was already<br>
  smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when<br>
  suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls<br>
  running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a<br>
  girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin<br>
  frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was<br>
  evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far.<br>
  Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat<br>
  collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump<br>
  rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.<br>
  <br>
  The count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his<br>
  arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.<br>
  <br>
  "Ah, here she is!" he exclaimed laughing. "My pet, whose name day it<br>
  is. My dear pet!"<br>
  <br>
  "Ma chere, there is a time for everything," said the countess with<br>
  feigned severity. "You spoil her, Ilya," she added, turning to her<br>
  husband.<br>
  <br>
  "How do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your<br>
  name day," said the visitor. "What a charming child," she added,<br>
  addressing the mother.<br>
  <br>
  This black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life-<br>
  with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook<br>
  her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little<br>
  legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers- was just at<br>
  that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child<br>
  is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her<br>
  flushed face in the lace of her mother's mantilla- not paying the<br>
  least attention to her severe remark- and began to laugh. She laughed,<br>
  and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she<br>
  produced from the folds of her frock.<br>
  <br>
  "Do you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see..." was all Natasha<br>
  managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned<br>
  against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter<br>
  that even the prim visitor could not help joining in.<br>
